    <h2>Season 7 Faker</h2>안녕하세요 <strong>반갑<u>습</u>니다</strong>
    <p>Faker <strong>renewed his contract with SK Telecom T1</strong> with an "unprecedented offer" [11] which was rumored to be over US$2.5 million.</p>

    <p>On February 6, 2017, Faker recorded his first livestream on Twitch.tv and recorded a peak views at 245,100, a record at the time for the most views for a single streamer in the history of the site. However, this record was broken in early 2018 by another League of Legends streamer named loltyler1.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px">At the Season 7 World Championship, SKT were still considered by many to be strong favourites to lift the cup for a 3rd consecutive time despite losing the LCK. After a dominant group stage conceding just 1 loss, SKT narrowly defeated Misfits and Royal Never Give Up in the Quarter- and Semi-Finals, respectively, before having to face Samsung Galaxy in what was a repeat of the previous year's Final. SKT's fate was sealed after Faker was caught by a flash Varus ult move by Samsung AD Carry Ruler, resulting in Samsung Galaxy clean sweeping SKT 3-0, ending the SKT domination at the World Championship. Faker himself was shown to be visibly upset after the loss, and had to be consoled by his teammates to shake the Samsung Galaxy players' hands post-game. However, this caught the attention of many League of Legends fans throughout the world, with much support and many tributes being given to the team's legacy and Faker for their sustained success, a rarity in Esports, especially among professional League of Legends teams.</p>
